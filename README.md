# TODOApp
This is basic TODO Application using only C++ and Bash Language.

# How to run and understanding the structure of the Application:
Application's main logic is in main.cpp file.
transfer.sh is used to transfer tasks from TODO to DONE folders when executed.
At first TODO folder contains tasks.txt file and when it is marked done tasks.txt will make copy into DONE folder. (For this, I used Bash Language)

Hopefully, you will use test it yourself and maybe use it from time to time for your TODO listing. To run this application properly you need to have compiler to execute C++ code.
This TODO application is awesome on Linux OS for me.
